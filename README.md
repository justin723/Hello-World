# Hello-World
just getting started. I'm trying to figure this out, so any advice woill help.
I'm a student currently studying IT. my overall goal is to learn computers inside and out. I'm fascinated with math and i know thats all a computer is, i just dont know how it works so im going to school for it. I have had a hard time at life so far so i'm hoping to make some money.
